    <h3>SMART HELMET: SMART SOLUTION FOR BIKE RIDERS
    </h3>
    <p>In this system we developed a “Smart Helmet” which detects the alcohol consumed by the rider 
        and whether the rider has worn the helmet or not hopefully this system will provide the rider’s

    <h3>VEHICLE TO VEHICLE COMMUNICATION
    </h3>
    <p>Vehicle to Vehicle Communication in this system, we are receiving the vehicle information 
        such that breaking status, direction, speed and transmitting this to the vehicles in the vicinity 
        vehicles. For breaking status Force sensing register is used. For direction accelerometer sensor 
        is used and for speed calculation Hall Effect sensor is used. All this information is displayed on 
        display in vehicle. Due to that driver or autonomous vehicle will get assistance and can take 
        preemptive action so that he/she/it can drive safely.</p>
